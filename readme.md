# Persistence

A different way to use keepInventory, without being too powerful.

IMPORTANT: the keepInventory gamerule MUST be set to false. This plugin will not work properly with keepInventory enabled and you may lose your items.

How to use:

1. Craft a Reinforced Emerald by surrounding an emerald with iron ingots. 
2. Put the item you want to be Persistent in either your main hand or your offhand.
3. Run the command /makepersistent <player> <main | offhand>
4. Die

When you die, any Persistent item in your inventory (including items inside Shulker boxes) will stay with you when you respawn. Everything else will drop as normal.
Also note that all Shulker boxes will automatically become Persistent after placing and breaking them.

This plugin supports automatic updates through my custom server launcher:
